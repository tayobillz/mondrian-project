# ðŸŽ¨ Mondrian Grid Project

This project is a replica of Piet Mondrian's abstract art style â€” built using only HTML and CSS grid. No external stylesheets, no JavaScript â€” just pure layout practice.

## ðŸ§± What It Shows

- CSS Grid layout in action
- Abstract art made with code
- Color blocks styled with specific dimensions and placement
- No external CSS or files â€” all styles live in the `<style>` tag

## ðŸŽ¨ Colors Used

- Red: `#E72F24`
- Blue: `#004592`
- Yellow: `#F9D01E`
- Black: `#232629`
- White: `#F0F1EC`
- Gap (grid lines): `#000`

## ðŸ’» What I Practiced

- Building complex layouts using CSS Grid
- Using `grid-area`, `grid-column`, and `grid-row` effectively
- Styling inside the `<style>` tag
- Thinking visually and translating art into HTML structure

## ðŸš€ How to View

1. Clone or download the project  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. That's it â€” no setup needed!
